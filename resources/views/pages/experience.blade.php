                <p>The edge Executive Chef Nyoman Suasa has enjoyed a long and distinguished culinary career. He began his training with Four Seasons Hotels in Bali then travelled the globe, culminating in his appointment as Sous Chef at the world-renowned Beverly Wilshire Hotel on Rodeo Drive, Los Angeles. During his time at the landmark hotel, he served&nbsp;celebrity guests and catered high-profile weddings, whilst also assisting with the opening of Chef Wolfgang Pucks’ award-winning in-house restaurant CUT.&nbsp;Returning to Bali, Chef Suasa was appointed Executive Chef to open Bali’s paean to authentic indigenous cuisine, Bambu and also oversaw culinary operations at sister restaurant and Seminyak institution La Lucciola.</p>
                <p>Food &amp; Beverage Manager Nyoman Suwinda Yasa has enjoyed an impressive career with five-star establishments including kudeta and most recently as Beverage Manager &amp; Sommelier of Metis Restaurant. His outstanding knowledge of fine wines was recognized with his award as Bali’s Best Sommelier for 2016.</p>
                <h3><strong>ROMANCE</strong></h3>
                <p>Many centuries ago, Danghyang Nirartha&nbsp;was an important Hindu priest in the royal courts of Java and, less fortuitously, the object of unrequited love from one of the wives of his royal patron. This unenviable position precipitated his rapid departure to Bali, where he became the chief counsellor to King Dalem Baturenggong.</p>
                <p>On his arrival to the Southern tip of the island, Nirartha meditated on the edge of the cliff and received a sacred vision about the sanctity of the area. Thus, a temple was built and called Uluwatu (<em>ulu</em> - land’s end, <em>watu</em> – rock). Pura Luhur Uluwatu, is one of the Sad Khayangan, the six most important temples in Bali. It is dedicated to Rudra, the God of the Storm, the Wind, and the Hunt.</p>
                <p>These days&nbsp;at The edge, a short journey from the famous temple, guests are more commonly embracing love, rather than fleeing it as Niratha did. With dedicated, yet discrete butler service, superlative food &amp; beverage, a breathtaking spa and truly opulent villas and facilities set amongst lush tropical gardens, The edge provides the perfect setting to indulge in a dream honeymoon or enjoy a private romantic escape.</p>
                <h3><strong>AWARDS</strong></h3>

We are committed to maintaining the beauty of this environment through recycling of wastewater on our gardens and numerous&nbsp;waste minimisation initiatives.&nbsp;</p>
                   <p>We are actively engaged in supporting and recruiting from our local village of Pecatu, with many of our staff&nbsp;able to&nbsp;trace their ancestors back to this village over many generations. Through our 'Life on The edge' program, we actively reinvest in the health and wellbeing of our staff, the local community and the people of Bali and beyond.</p>
